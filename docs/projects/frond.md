# Frond

**Game design primitives library in Rust.**

Frond provides reusable game design primitives for common gameplay patterns. Built with game development in mind, it integrates well with engines like Bevy.

## Key Features

- **State Machines** - Game logic primitives for AI, animation, and gameplay
- **Character Controllers** - Movement systems for various game types
- **Camera Controllers** - Common camera behaviors (follow, orbit, first-person)

## Philosophy

Frond extracts common patterns from game development into reusable, composable primitives. Rather than building everything from scratch, you assemble gameplay systems from well-tested building blocks.
