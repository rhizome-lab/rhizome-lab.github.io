# Projects

Rhizome is an ecosystem of tools for programmable creativity—software that treats code, worlds, and media as malleable structures rather than opaque text or binary blobs.

## Active Projects

### [Moss](/projects/moss)

Structural code intelligence for humans and AI agents. Moss provides AST-aware tools for understanding, navigating, and modifying code across 98 languages.

### [Lotus](/projects/lotus)

A LambdaMOO-inspired Lua runtime with persistent entity storage. Build scriptable objects, rooms, NPCs, and multiplayer worlds with capability-based security.

### [Hypha](/projects/hypha)

Federation protocol for persistent worlds. Authoritative handoff between servers—no state merging, no split-brain attacks.

### [Resin](/projects/resin)

Constructive media generation in Rust. Procedural meshes, audio synthesis, textures, 2D vector graphics, and skeletal rigging with composable node graphs.

### [Frond](/projects/frond)

Game design primitives library. State machines, character controllers, camera systems, and common gameplay patterns.

### [Dew](/projects/dew)

Minimal expression language for procedural generation. Small, ephemeral, perfectly formed. Compiles to WGSL shaders, Cranelift JIT, or Lua.

### [Liana](/projects/liana)

API bindings IR and code generation. Unified representation for generating bindings across languages and frameworks.

### [Cambium](/projects/cambium)

Pipeline orchestrator for data conversion. Type-driven route planning for asset pipelines—agents declare intent, Cambium finds the path.

### [Canopy](/projects/canopy)

Universal UI client with control plane. View, mutate, and control any data source through configurable interfaces.

### [Siphon](/projects/siphon)

Legacy software lifting framework. Extract and transform applications from obsolete runtimes (Flash, Director, VB6) into modern web equivalents.

### [Nursery](/projects/nursery)

Ecosystem orchestrator. One `rhizome.toml` manifest to coordinate all Rhizome tools for your project.
